## Creating package
You can use the following command to create a package from this project.

```sh
./publish.sh
```

You can run `npm run dev` inside the `web` folder to start the extension UI inside your browser.
This will not run the node server used to connect to Contoso.

## Debug
By pressing F5 and check the Ouput Panel if you want to develop with a vscode window instead of a browser.
